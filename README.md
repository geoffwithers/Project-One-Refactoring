# Project-One-Refactoring

Name: Project One HTML/CSS Refactoring

Description: This is the repository for my first assignment, Module 1 Refactoring. Within this index.html page I replaced all <div> elements with more appropriate semantic HTML elements. Also, within the CSS stylesheet, I consolidated many redundant sections by combining them.
